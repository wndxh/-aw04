# WebPOS

The demo shows a web POS system , which replaces the in-memory product db in aw03 with a one backed by 京东.

To run

```shell
mvn clean spring-boot:run
```

Currently, it creates a new session for each user and the session data is stored in an in-memory h2 db. 
And it also fetches a product list from jd.com every time a session begins.

1. Build a docker image for this application and performance a load testing against it.
2. Make this system horizontally scalable by using haproxy and performance a load testing against it.
3. Take care of the **cache missing** problem (you may cache the products from jd.com) and **session sharing** problem (you may use a standalone mysql db or a redis cluster). Performance load testings.

Please **write a report** on the performance differences you notices among the above tasks.
